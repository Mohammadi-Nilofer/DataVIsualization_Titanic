🚢 Titanic Data Visualization using Python
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python’s powerful visualization libraries — Matplotlib and Seaborn. The goal is to uncover survival patterns through visual storytelling and gain meaningful insights from the data.

📌 Objective
To visually explore and interpret the Titanic dataset by answering key questions about survival factors such as age, class, fare, gender, and family size.

🧠 Key Questions Explored
What is the distribution of passenger ages on the Titanic?

How does the survival rate vary based on passenger class (Pclass)?

Is there a relationship between fare paid and likelihood of survival?

How does the survival rate differ between male and female passengers?

What impact does the number of siblings/spouses (SibSp) or parents/children (Parch) aboard have on survival?

Are there survival rate differences among passengers embarked from different ports?

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

💡 Insights
Gender and class significantly affected survival chances.

1st class passengers had higher survival rates than 2nd and 3rd.

Women and children were more likely to survive.

Very large or very small family groups had lower survival rates.

Higher fares generally correlated with better survival outcomes.

📎 Dataset
The Titanic dataset is publicly available and widely used for classification and EDA tasks. (Note: The dataset file is either included in the repository or can be sourced externally.)
